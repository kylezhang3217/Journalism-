# Journalism-

One of my interests is journalism. 

In 2013, I was accepted into the Princeton University Summer Journalism Program, which provides prospective college students an
overview into the world of journalism. Some of my articles are provided here. 

During high school, I entered Huffington Post's Students Sound Off writing contest, got my work published on their website, and was extended an invitation
to blog for them.
